title: "Topics (WIP)"

We intentionally keep the scope broad: **grand challenges for systems in the AI era** (from OS/runtime all the way to large-scale AI infrastructure).
Below is a **partial / WIP** list of sub-topics aligned with the lab’s research focus:

<ul class="list-group">
  {% for t in site.data.conference.topics_wip %}
  <li class="list-group-item">{{ t }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info rounded mt-3">
  <strong>WIP:</strong> This is not the final topic list. We will keep refining it as speakers confirm their challenge pitches.
</div>
